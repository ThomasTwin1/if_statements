# If Statements checks the conditions of your code to be true or false.
if 1 > -2:
    print("one is greater than two")
# 1 is greater than 2 in this example so "one is greater than two" is printed

if 1 > 2:
    print("one is greater than two")
# This statement is false and therefore does not print. Notice the false statement is underlined yellow.
# Let's add an else statement to check whether the expression is true or false

if 1 > 2:
    print("one is greater than two")
else:
    print("one is not greater than two")
# In this example 1 is not greater than 2 therefore the first print statement is underlined yellow and the else statement is printed.

# You can also check an expression directly simply by typing it and running it in the console.
print(1 > 2) # Output: False
# In this case python checks the code directly to be true or false.


# It's loop time!
# Let's add an if statement to a loop
fruits = ['apple','banana','peach','grape']
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == 'grape':
        print("It's peanut butter jelly time!")
    else:
        print(fruit.title())
# Output:
# Apple
# Banana
# Peach
# It's peanut butter jelly time!
# This loop prints "It's peanut butter jelly time!" when grape is the value in the fruit variable.
