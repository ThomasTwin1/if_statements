# Checking for Equality
# Now that we know how to add if/else statements let's look at checking expressions for equality
pizza = "pepperoni"

# Check if the value of pizza equals "pepperoni"
print(pizza == "pepperoni")  # Output: True
# If a variable is assigned a value, the variable holds that value and is considered equal to it when compared using the == operator.

# You can also check fo inequality:
pizza = "pepperoni"

# Check if the value of pizza not equal to "pepperoni"
print(pizza != "pepperoni")  # Output: False
# Since pizza is equal to pepperoni this statement is false
